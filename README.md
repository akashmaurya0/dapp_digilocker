A Decentralized DigiLocker application built using React and Solidity, enabling secure and efficient document storage, sharing, and access control powered by blockchain technology.

Features
Secure Document Storage: Upload documents to IPFS and link them with blockchain for immutability and transparency.
Access Control: Grant or revoke access to specific users for stored documents.
Request Management: Users can request access to documents, and owners can approve or reject requests.
File Replacement: Replace outdated documents while maintaining the same file name.
Detailed Document Logs: View document details, including file name, owner, and upload timestamp.
Efficient Sharing: Share documents with specific Ethereum addresses.
Access Revocation: Revoke access to shared documents at any time.
Delete Documents: Owners can permanently delete documents.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface compatible with all devices.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
